      I am currently starting a journey in the domain of progrmation using
      Swift. As a mathematician, I find it challenging to design an efficent
      algorithm to solve a computational problem and to write down the code.

      I am using my teaching experience and the skills acquired during my carrer
      of resercher in mathematics to launch a
      <span style="color: red">YOUTUBE</span> channel to help people to start
      their journey in the domain of programation and development.

      Coding challenge of the week consists of a coding interview question I
      give to the communauty of programmers to solve. At the end, I will give
      the naswer in Swift.
